    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Tools and Technologiestives</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For this project, we will be using the following tools and technologies:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Python: A popular programming language for data analysis.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment for running Python code and presenting analysis.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Plotly: A data visualization library for creating insightful charts and graphs.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Dataset</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The primary dataset for this project contains information on hospitality establishments in the UK. It includes data on revenue, customer footfall, occupancy rates, and other relevant metrics. The data covers a specific period, including pre-pandemic and pandemic months. The dataset is collected from various sources, including government reports and industry publications.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Project Outline</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The project will be divided into the following main stages:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Data Collection: Gather data from different sources and compile it into CSV and Excel files.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis, handle missing values, and perform necessary transformations.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform preliminary analysis to understand the data's characteristics and identify interesting trends.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Data Visualization: Use Plotly to create interactive charts and graphs for a comprehensive visual representation of the data.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Interpretation and Conclusion: Draw insights from the analysis and summarize the findings.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations for the hospitality industry based on the results.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Data Collection and Preprocessing</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For this data analysis project, we collected the necessary data from two main sources: the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the UK. The data provided valuable insights into key performance indicators and financial metrics of the hospitality industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was obtained in the form of Excel files. However, before proceeding with the analysis, it was essential to clean the data and transform it into a more suitable format. I removed unnecessary text and irrelevant columns, keeping only the information relevant to our analysis. Additionally, we addressed any missing or inconsistent data points to ensure the data's quality and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the data cleaning process, I converted the Excel files into CSV format, which is more accessible and compatible with the Python data analysis libraries I used. To keep the data organized, a special folder was created within the project directory to store all the cleaned CSV files securely.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Data Source</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Data Collection and Preprocessing</h3>\n",

    "\n",
    "<h2>Limitations</h2>\n",
    "<p>While this data analysis project aims to provide valuable insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry in the UK, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations that could influence the interpretation of the findings:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Data Availability:</strong> The analysis relies on data collected from various sources, which may have limitations in terms of availability, completeness, and reliability. The data used in the analysis might not encompass the entire breadth of the hospitality industry.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Data Quality:</strong> Despite efforts to clean and preprocess the data, there might be instances of missing or inconsistent data points, potentially affecting the accuracy and robustness of the analysis.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Representativeness:</strong> The dataset used in the analysis might not fully represent the entire hospitality industry in the UK. It could be confined to specific regions, types of establishments, or business sizes, limiting the generalizability of the results.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Assumptions:</strong> The analysis involves certain assumptions made during data imputations, modeling techniques, and interpretation of the results. These assumptions could introduce uncertainties in the analysis.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Time Period:</strong> The analysis covers a specific period, and the conclusions drawn from that timeframe might not be applicable to other time periods. The dynamic nature of the hospitality industry could lead to different outcomes over time.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>External Factors:</strong> The analysis might not account for external factors that could have influenced the results. Economic or policy changes outside the scope of this analysis could impact the hospitality industry.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Causality vs. Correlation:</strong> While the analysis establishes correlations between variables, it might not establish causality. Other underlying factors could be influencing the observed trends.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Scope of the Analysis:</strong> The analysis focuses on specific aspects of the hospitality industry, such as economic output and customer behavior. It may not encompass all dimensions of the industry's impact, such as the social or psychological effects.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Future Uncertainties:</strong> The analysis might not consider potential future changes or uncertainties in the hospitality industry, particularly concerning the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<p>It is crucial to interpret the findings of this analysis with these limitations in mind. Transparency regarding these constraints ensures a comprehensive understanding of the scope and applicability of the results to real-world scenarios.</p>\n",
